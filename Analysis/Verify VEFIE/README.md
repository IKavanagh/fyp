# Quick Overview #

Initial verification of FFT compatible VEFIE derivation with the total electric field as the primary unknown and the VEFIE formulation for polarisation currents.

Comparison of real part of total electric field of VEFIE solutions with similar for the Mie Series (analytic solution) to determine accuracy.
